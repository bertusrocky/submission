2. Stay in the home directory and type in the following commands:
FLASK_APP=submission

3. Acces the web app in your browser:

4. I already created a student user and an admin login for you.

Student login
student number: 22222222
password: 22222222

Admin login
student number: 0
password: 0

Alternatively you can register new users, but the Admin must use the credentials above.
